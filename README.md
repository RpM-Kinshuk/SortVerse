# **SortVerse**
**A research project comparing various sorting techniques and their optimizations across different languages in an attempt to highlight the best use cases for each.**

The project contains performance analysis of **10 major sorting algorithms** across **C**, **C++**, **Java** and **Python**.
More languages and sorting algorithms can be directly integrated with the project with ease.
The environment for each language and algorithm is ensured to be the fairest possible with minimum dependencies on custom or in-built libraries and optimized codes for swapping and stopping.

Furthermore, the project contains a total of **12 sorting algorithms** that can be visualized through the **SortVerse Visualizer**, which is a desktop application built as a part of the project for any machine that has the language framework for Python installed.
It installs it's 2 dependencies i.e. the **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** libraries before execution and has user defined algorithm and speed choice. <br> <br>
